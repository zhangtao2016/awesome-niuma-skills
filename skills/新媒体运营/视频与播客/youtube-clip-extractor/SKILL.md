# YouTube Clip Extractor

## Overview

This skill downloads YouTube videos, analyzes transcripts for compelling clip moments, extracts clips using ffmpeg, and generates platform-ready on-screen text and captions. It integrates with the existing caption and social content skills to deliver complete, publishable assets.

## When to Use This Skill

- You have a YouTube URL and want to extract the best clips
- You want automated clip identification based on hook/coda criteria
- You need clips cut and ready for Descript or other editors
- You want on-screen text hooks and platform-specific captions for each clip

**Do NOT use for:**
- Full podcast production workflow (use `podcast-production` skill instead)
- Text-only social posts (use `social-content-creation` skill)
- Already-downloaded videos (skip to Phase 2)

---

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools (install via Homebrew)

```bash
brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg
```

### File Location

All downloads go to your project's transcript folder (customizable).

Structure:
```
transcripts/
├── {video_id}.mp4              # Full video (H.264 encoded)
├── {video_id}.en.vtt           # Timestamped subtitles
└── clips/
    └── {video_id}/
        ├── clip_01_{name}.mp4  # Individual clips
        ├── clip_02_{name}.mp4
        └── {video_id}_Clip_Assets.md  # Captions & hooks
```

## The 4-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Download Video & Transcript

**Goal:** Get video and subtitles from YouTube URL

#### Step 1: Download with H.264 Encoding

Use H.264 format for Descript compatibility (NOT AV1):

```bash
# Download video in H.264 format (Descript-compatible)
yt-dlp -f "bestvideo[vcodec^=avc]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/best[vcodec^=avc]" \
  --merge-output-format mp4 \
  -o "transcripts/{video_id}.mp4" \
  "YOUTUBE_URL"

# If H.264 unavailable, download best quality then re-encode:
yt-dlp -f "bestvideo+bestaudio" --merge-output-format mp4 \
  -o "transcripts/{video_id}_temp.mp4" \
  "YOUTUBE_URL"

# Re-encode to H.264 for Descript compatibility
ffmpeg -i "{video_id}_temp.mp4" -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 22 \
  -c:a aac -b:a 128k "{video_id}.mp4"
```

#### Step 2: Download Subtitles

```bash
yt-dlp --write-auto-sub --sub-lang en --skip-download \
  -o "transcripts/{video_id}.%(ext)s" \
  "YOUTUBE_URL"
```

#### Phase 1 Output:
- `{video_id}.mp4` - Full video (H.264)
- `{video_id}.en.vtt` - Timestamped subtitles

---

### Phase 2: Analyze Transcript for Clips

**Goal:** Identify 5-8 compelling clip moments with strong hooks and codas

#### Clip Selection Criteria

**A good clip has:**

1. **Strong Hook (First 3 Seconds)**
   - Polarizing statement ("Most people get this completely wrong")
   - Counter-intuitive reveal ("The worst decision turned out to be the best")
   - Direct challenge ("Stop doing this immediately")
   - Curiosity gap ("Then everything changed...")

2. **Complete Arc (30-90 seconds)**
   - Clear beginning, middle, end
   - Not just a "good quote" - a complete thought
   - Setup -> Tension -> Resolution OR Setup -> Tension -> Cliffhanger

3. **Stakes**
   - Why does this matter?
   - Who cares?
   - What's at risk?

4. **Strong Coda/Ending**
   - Insight or surprising conclusion
   - Cuts right before the answer (cliffhanger)
   - Quotable final line

#### Scan Transcript For:

**Inflection Points:**
- "Then everything changed..."
- "I realized..."
- "That's when I knew..."
- "The moment I..."

**Vulnerability Moments:**
- Personal stakes, failures, struggles
- "I was terrified..."
- "I almost gave up..."
- "Nobody believed..."

**Contradiction Moments:**
- "We thought X but actually..."
- "Everyone says... but the truth is..."
- "The opposite happened..."

**Surprising Insights:**
- Research, data, unexpected findings
- Counter-intuitive conclusions
- "What we found was..."

**Character in Action:**
- Showing, not telling
- Doing, not describing
- Specific moments, not abstractions

#### Quality Tests (Pass 4/5):

- [ ] **Stranger Test:** Would someone with zero context care?
- [ ] **Itch Test:** Creates need to know more?
- [ ] **Stakes Test:** Clear why it matters?
- [ ] **Tease Test:** Hints without giving away?
- [ ] **Emotion Test:** Feel something in first 5 seconds?

#### Phase 2 Output Format:

Create analysis document with clip recommendations:

```markdown
# {Video Title} - Clip Analysis

## Video Details
- **URL:** [YouTube URL]
- **Duration:** [Total length]
- **Speaker(s):** [Names]
- **Topic:** [Primary subject]

---

## Recommended Clips

### CLIP 1: "{Descriptive Name}"
**Timestamp:** `MM:SS - MM:SS` (XX seconds)
**Hook:** [First line or opening moment]
**Arc:** [Setup -> Middle -> Ending summary]
**Coda:** [How it ends / final line]

**Key Quotes:**
- "[Verbatim quote 1]"
- "[Verbatim quote 2]"
- "[Verbatim quote 3]"

**Quality Tests:** Stranger YES | Itch YES | Stakes YES | Tease YES | Emotion YES
**Why It Works:** [1-2 sentence rationale]
**Priority:** HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW

---

### CLIP 2: "{Descriptive Name}"
[Repeat structure...]

---

## Summary Table

| # | Clip Name | Timestamp | Length | Hook | Coda | Priority |
|---|-----------|-----------|--------|------|------|----------|
| 1 | [Name] | MM:SS-MM:SS | XXs | Strong | Strong | HIGH |
| 2 | [Name] | MM:SS-MM:SS | XXs | Strong | Good | HIGH |
| 3 | [Name] | MM:SS-MM:SS | XXs | Good | Strong | MEDIUM |
```

---

### Phase 3: Cut Clips with FFmpeg

**Goal:** Extract approved clips as separate video files

#### Cutting Commands

**Basic clip extraction (fast, uses keyframes):**
```bash
ffmpeg -i "{video_id}.mp4" -ss MM:SS -to MM:SS -c copy \
  "clips/{video_id}/clip_01_{name}.mp4"
```

**Precise cutting with re-encoding (slower but frame-accurate):**
```bash
ffmpeg -ss MM:SS -i "{video_id}.mp4" -t DURATION \
  -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 22 -c:a aac -b:a 128k \
  "clips/{video_id}/clip_01_{name}.mp4"
```

**Notes:**
- `-ss` before `-i` = faster seeking (recommended)
- `-c copy` = no re-encoding (fast but may have keyframe issues)
- `-c:v libx264` = re-encode to H.264 (slower but precise)
- Use H.264 output for Descript compatibility

#### Batch Cutting Example

```bash
# Create clips directory
mkdir -p "transcripts/clips/{video_id}"

# Cut each clip
ffmpeg -i "{video_id}.mp4" -ss 06:59 -to 08:10 -c copy "clips/{video_id}/clip_01_key_insight.mp4"
ffmpeg -i "{video_id}.mp4" -ss 20:50 -to 21:54 -c copy "clips/{video_id}/clip_02_main_story.mp4"
ffmpeg -i "{video_id}.mp4" -ss 25:00 -to 26:10 -c copy "clips/{video_id}/clip_03_surprising_turn.mp4"
```

#### Phase 3 Output:
- Individual MP4 files for each clip
- All files in `clips/{video_id}/` directory
- H.264 encoded for Descript compatibility

---

### Phase 4: Generate On-Screen Text & Captions

**Goal:** Create platform-optimized hooks and captions for each clip

**This phase uses the `video-caption-creation` skill methodology.**

#### For Each Clip, Generate:

**1. On-Screen Text Hook (3-5 options)**

The text that appears in the first 3 seconds of the video. Must be:
- 2-4 words maximum (mobile readable)
- Stops the scroll
- Passes McDonald's Test (accessible language)
- Complements (not duplicates) audio

**Hook Categories:**
- **Polarizing:** "Most people get this wrong"
- **Counter-Intuitive:** "The worst decision was the best"
- **Direct Challenge:** "Stop doing this immediately"
- **Curiosity Gap:** "Then everything changed..."

**2. Platform-Specific Captions**

| Platform | On-Screen Text | Caption Style | Hashtags |
|----------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| Instagram | Same | Short, emoji OK, accessible | 5-10 |
| TikTok | Same | Short, emoji OK, accessible | 3-5 |
| YouTube Shorts | Same | Short, minimal emoji | 3-5 + #Shorts |
| Facebook | Same | Slightly longer, conversational, NO external links | 0-2 |

**Facebook Difference:** Caption can be longer and more conversational. NO hashtags or external links (kills reach).

**3. Algorithm Optimization**

Per the Triple Word Score system:
- **Audio:** Topic words spoken in first 10 seconds
- **On-Screen Text:** Reinforces (not competes with) audio
- **Caption:** Topic-relevant keywords in first sentence
- **Hashtags:** Broad -> Mid -> Specific -> Niche (10-12 total)

#### Phase 4 Output Format:

Create file: `clips/{video_id}/{video_id}_CLIP_PACKAGE.md`

```markdown
# {Video Title} - Clip Package

## Source Video
- **URL:** [YouTube URL]
- **Title:** [Video title]
- **Duration:** [Total length]
- **Downloaded File:** `{video_id}.mp4`

---

## Context

[2-3 sentences explaining the backstory needed to understand the clip. Who is the speaker? What's their situation? What happened before/after the moments in the clip? This context ensures on-screen text and captions are coherent with the actual story.]

---

## Editing Instructions

**SEQUENCE (Rearranged from original - NOT linear):**

| Order | Timestamp | Speaker | Line |
|-------|-----------|---------|------|
| 1 | MM:SS-MM:SS | [Name] | "[Verbatim quote]" |
| 2 | MM:SS-MM:SS | [Name] | "[Verbatim quote]" |
| 3 | MM:SS-MM:SS | [Name] | "[Verbatim quote]" |

**OPTIONAL EXTENSION:**

| Order | Timestamp | Speaker | Line |
|-------|-----------|---------|------|
| 4 | MM:SS-MM:SS | [Name] | "[Verbatim quote]" |

---

## On-Screen Text Hook Options

1. **[Hook text]** - [Category]
2. **[Hook text]** - [Category]
3. **[Hook text]** - [Category]
4. **[Hook text]** - [Category]
5. **[Hook text]** - [Category]
6. **[Hook text]** - [Category]
7. **[Hook text]** - [Category]
8. **[Hook text]** - [Category]
9. **[Hook text]** - [Category]
10. **[Hook text]** - [Category]

---

## Platform Captions

### TikTok / Instagram Reels / YouTube Shorts
[Caption text]

[Hashtags: 3-5]

---

### Facebook
[Longer caption, conversational, NO hashtags]

---

### LinkedIn
[Professional tone caption]

[Hashtags: 3-5]
```

#### On-Screen Text Hook Categories

- **Story Setup** - Provides context that makes the clip make sense (e.g., "First day on the job")
- **Polarizing** - Bold statement that divides opinion (e.g., "Most experts are wrong")
- **Contrast** - Juxtaposition that creates tension (e.g., "Top performer. Zero passion.")
- **Curiosity Gap** - Teases without revealing (e.g., "What happened next changed everything")
- **Story Tease** - Hints at narrative arc (e.g., "She quit three days later")
- **Pattern Interrupt** - Subverts expectations (e.g., "This isn't what it looks like")

#### Context-Caption Coherence

**Critical:** On-screen text and captions must be coherent with the actual story in the transcript. Before writing hooks:

1. Understand the full context (who, what, when, why)
2. Identify what viewers need to know for the clip to make sense
3. Choose hooks that accurately represent the story
4. Avoid hooks that would confuse viewers when they hear the audio

**Example:** If the clip shows someone criticizing their previous job, but they were actually recounting their first week before they loved it, hooks like "First week was brutal" or "It gets better - trust me" provide necessary context that makes the story coherent.
