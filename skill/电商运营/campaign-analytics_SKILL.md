# Campaign Analytics

Production-grade campaign performance analysis with multi-touch attribution modeling, funnel conversion analysis, and ROI calculation. Three Python CLI tools provide deterministic, repeatable analytics using standard library only -- no external dependencies, no API calls, no ML models.

    "stages": ["Awareness", "Interest", "Consideration", "Intent", "Purchase"],
    "counts": [10000, 5200, 2800, 1400, 420]
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "campaigns": [
    {
      "name": "Spring Email Campaign",

      "leads": 300,
      "customers": 45
    }
  ]
}
```

## Output Formats

All scripts support two output formats via the `--format` flag:

- `--format text` (default): Human-readable tables and summaries for review
- `--format json`: Machine-readable JSON for integrations and pipelines

---

## How to Use

### Attribution Analysis

```bash
# Run all 5 attribution models
python scripts/attribution_analyzer.py campaign_data.json

# Run a specific model
python scripts/attribution_analyzer.py campaign_data.json --model time-decay

# JSON output for pipeline integration
python scripts/attribution_analyzer.py campaign_data.json --format json

# Custom time-decay half-life (default: 7 days)
python scripts/attribution_analyzer.py campaign_data.json --model time-decay --half-life 14
```

### Funnel Analysis

```bash
# Basic funnel analysis
python scripts/funnel_analyzer.py funnel_data.json

# JSON output
python scripts/funnel_analyzer.py funnel_data.json --format json
```

### Campaign ROI Calculation

```bash
# Calculate ROI metrics for all campaigns
python scripts/campaign_roi_calculator.py campaign_data.json

# JSON output
python scripts/campaign_roi_calculator.py campaign_data.json --format json
```

## Scripts

### 1. attribution_analyzer.py

Implements five industry-standard attribution models to allocate conversion credit across marketing channels:

| Model | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| First-Touch | 100% credit to first interaction | Brand awareness campaigns |
| Last-Touch | 100% credit to last interaction | Direct response campaigns |
| Linear | Equal credit to all touchpoints | Balanced multi-channel evaluation |
| Time-Decay | More credit to recent touchpoints | Short sales cycles |
| Position-Based | 40/20/40 split (first/middle/last) | Full-funnel marketing |

### 2. funnel_analyzer.py

Analyzes conversion funnels to identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities:

- Stage-to-stage conversion rates and drop-off percentages
- Automatic bottleneck identification (largest absolute and relative drops)
- Overall funnel conversion rate
- Segment comparison when multiple segments are provided

### 3. campaign_roi_calculator.py

Calculates comprehensive ROI metrics with industry benchmarking:

- **ROI**: Return on investment percentage
- **ROAS**: Return on ad spend ratio
- **CPA**: Cost per acquisition
- **CPL**: Cost per lead
- **CAC**: Customer acquisition cost
- **CTR**: Click-through rate
- **CVR**: Conversion rate (leads to customers)
- Flags underperforming campaigns against industry benchmarks

| Guide | Location | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Attribution Models Guide | `references/attribution-models-guide.md` | Deep dive into 5 models with formulas, pros/cons, selection criteria |
| Campaign Metrics Benchmarks | `references/campaign-metrics-benchmarks.md` | Industry benchmarks by channel and vertical for CTR, CPC, CPM, CPA, ROAS |
| Funnel Optimization Framework | `references/funnel-optimization-framework.md` | Stage-by-stage optimization strategies, common bottlenecks, best practices |

## Best Practices

1. **Use multiple attribution models** -- No single model tells the full story. Compare at least 3 models to triangulate channel value.
2. **Set appropriate lookback windows** -- Match your time-decay half-life to your average sales cycle length.
3. **Segment your funnels** -- Always compare segments (channel, cohort, geography) to identify what drives best performance.
4. **Benchmark against your own history first** -- Industry benchmarks provide context, but your own historical data is the most relevant comparison.
5. **Run ROI analysis at regular intervals** -- Weekly for active campaigns, monthly for strategic review.
6. **Include all costs** -- Factor in creative, tooling, and labor costs alongside media spend for accurate ROI.
7. **Document A/B tests rigorously** -- Use the provided template to ensure statistical validity and clear decision criteria.

---

## Limitations

- **No statistical significance testing** -- A/B test analysis requires external tools for p-value calculations. Scripts provide descriptive metrics only.
- **Standard library only** -- No advanced statistical or data processing libraries. Suitable for most campaign sizes but not optimized for datasets exceeding 100K journeys.
- **Offline analysis** -- Scripts analyze static JSON snapshots. No real-time data connections or API integrations.
- **Single-currency** -- All monetary values assumed to be in the same currency. No currency conversion support.
- **Simplified time-decay** -- Uses exponential decay based on configurable half-life. Does not account for weekday/weekend or seasonal patterns.
- **No cross-device tracking** -- Attribution operates on provided journey data as-is. Cross-device identity resolution must be handled upstream.

## Proactive Triggers

- **Attribution model not set** → Last-click attribution misses 60%+ of the journey. Use multi-touch.
- **No baseline metrics documented** → Can't measure improvement without baselines.
- **Data discrepancy between tools** → GA4 and ad platform numbers rarely match. Document the gap.
- **Vanity metrics dominating reports** → Pageviews don't matter. Focus on conversion metrics.

## Output Artifacts

| When you ask for... | You get... |
|---------------------|------------|
| "Campaign report" | Cross-channel performance report with attribution analysis |
| "Channel comparison" | Channel-by-channel ROI with budget reallocation recommendations |
| "What's working?" | Top 5 performers + bottom 5 drains with specific actions |

## Communication

All output passes quality verification:
- Self-verify: source attribution, assumption audit, confidence scoring
- Output format: Bottom Line → What (with confidence) → Why → How to Act
- Results only. Every finding tagged: 🟢 verified, 🟡 medium, 🔴 assumed.
