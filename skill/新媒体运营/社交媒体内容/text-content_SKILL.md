# Text Content Creator

## Purpose

Transform source content into platform-optimized social posts using **framework fitting** - matching concepts to proven templates that amplify them. Covers LinkedIn long-form, X punchy tweets, Facebook engagement posts, Instagram captions, and one-liners.

**Core Philosophy:** Good content follows proven formats. The skill is matching concepts to the delivery mechanisms that amplify them best - not writing from scratch.

## When to Use

- Creating LinkedIn posts from any source content
- Writing X/Twitter posts or threads
- Facebook text posts and question posts
- Instagram captions (not video - use `short-form-video` for that)
- One-liners for easels, signs, or quick social
- Multiplying high-performing posts into variations

**NOT for:**
- Short-form video (use `short-form-video` skill)
- Video captions/on-screen text (use `video-caption-creation` skill)
- Blog posts or long-form articles

## The Framework Fitting Method

### Step 1: Extract the Concept

Before choosing a template, understand what you're working with.

**From source content, extract:**
- **Core insight** (one sentence)
- **Emotional hook** (what feeling does this evoke?)
- **Target reader** (who needs to hear this?)
- **Transformation** (what changes for the reader?)

### Step 2: Choose Platform and Format

**Platform selection question:** "Where does our target reader spend time?"

| Platform | Best For | Character Sweet Spot |
|----------|----------|---------------------|
| **LinkedIn** | Thought leadership, professional insight, stories | 200-500 words |
| **X/Twitter** | Punchy takes, quotable insights, threads | 70-100 chars (posts), threads for depth |
| **Facebook** | Engagement bait, questions, community | 40-140 chars |
| **Instagram** | Captions for visuals, micro-stories | 30-125 chars |

**Format selection question:** "What job does this post need to do?"

| If the job is... | Format |
|------------------|--------|
| Start a conversation | Engagement post (question, poll, agree/disagree) |
| Make them feel something | Story post (failure, transformation, day-in-life) |
| Give them something useful | List/Tips post (how-to, mistakes, frameworks) |
| Challenge what they believe | Contrarian post (hot take, call BS, flip expectation) |
| Establish credibility | Authority post (data, process reveal, pro tip) |
| Build relationships | Community post (shoutout, welcome, give away) |
| Stop the scroll quickly | One-liner (sign, easel, caption) |

### Step 3: Load the Right Reference

**IMPORTANT: Load only ONE reference at a time.** Each is 1000-3000 words.

#### For LinkedIn (Long-Form Thought Leadership)

LinkedIn has 118 templates across 6 categories. Load based on job-to-be-done:

| Job | Load | Template Count |
|-----|------|----------------|
| Drive comments | `references/linkedin/engagement.md` | 16 templates |
| Emotional connection | `references/linkedin/story.md` | 24 templates |
| Scannable value | `references/linkedin/list.md` | 17 templates |
| Pattern interrupt | `references/linkedin/contrarian.md` | 20 templates |
| Build credibility | `references/linkedin/authority.md` | 26 templates |
| Relationship building | `references/linkedin/community.md` | 15 templates |

#### For X/Twitter (Short and Punchy)

| Need | Load | Template Count |
|------|------|----------------|
| General post templates | `references/templates/post-structures.md` | 100+ templates |
| One-liners/takes | `references/templates/one-liners.md` | 12 patterns |
| Platform heuristics | `references/platforms/x-twitter.md` | - |

#### For Facebook (Engagement Focus)

| Post templates | `references/templates/post-structures.md` |
| Question/engagement templates | `references/linkedin/engagement.md` |
| Platform heuristics | `references/platforms/facebook.md` |

| Need | Load |

| 7 SCAMPER variations | `references/methods/proliferation.md` |
| 8 Human Desires reframes | `references/methods/proliferation.md` |
| Vision/Anti-Vision framing | `references/methods/proliferation.md` |

### Step 4: Match Concept to Templates

**Critical: Avoid First-Match Bias**

Do NOT default to the first template that fits. Review at least 5-10 options.

**For each concept:**
1. Brainstorm how it COULD be presented (beyond the obvious)
2. Review applicable templates from loaded reference
3. Test fit: Does this template amplify the core insight or dilute it?
4. Generate 2-4 framework matches with fit assessment
5. Select best 1-2 for execution

### Step 5: Execute and Adapt

**Templates are starting points, not constraints.**

Each template reference includes:
- The structural skeleton
- Why it works (psychological principle)
- Example execution

**Your job:** Adapt the template to your specific content. Combine elements if that serves the message better.

**Adaptation questions:**
- Does this amplify my core insight or dilute it?
- Does this sound like OpenEd/Ela, or like a template?
- Would Sarah (our target reader) feel seen?

### Step 6: Apply Voice and Quality Check

**Voice Checklist (Before Posting):**
- [ ] No correlative constructions ("isn't just X, it's Y") - #1 AI tell
- [ ] Hyphens with spaces - like this - not em dashes
- [ ] No emojis (or minimal, strategic use)
- [ ] Specific details over generic claims
- [ ] Permission-giving tone, not preachy
- [ ] Conversational - would you text this to a friend?

**AI-isms to Avoid:**
- Arrow bullets (use plain dashes or line breaks)
- "Here's the thing:" / "Let me explain:" throat-clearing
- Staccato fragments: "No fluff. No filler. Just results."
- Words: delve, comprehensive, crucial, leverage, landscape, navigate, foster

**Platform Compliance:**
- [ ] Character count appropriate
- [ ] Links in right place (LinkedIn: comments, Facebook: none)
- [ ] Hashtags appropriate (LinkedIn: 3-5, X: 1-2, Facebook: 0)

## Common Mistakes

**Content Issues:**
- First-Match Bias - picking first template without exploring
- Generic Posts - not using any framework
- Too Many Concepts - multiple ideas in one post
- Missing Context - concept doesn't stand alone

**Framework Issues:**
- Framework Drift - starting with template then abandoning structure
- Mismatched Fit - forcing concept into wrong template
- No Volume - creating only 1 option instead of 5-10

**Platform Issues:**
- Wrong Link Placement - external links in Facebook/LinkedIn main posts
- Hashtag Overload - too many for platform
- Voice Mismatch - too formal for Facebook, too casual for LinkedIn
