## Data Sources

> See [CONNECTORS.md](../../CONNECTORS.md) for tool category placeholders.

**With ~~SEO tool + ~~search console connected:**
Automatically pull keyword metrics (search volume, difficulty, CPC), competitor content analysis (top-ranking pages, content length, common topics), SERP features (featured snippets, PAA questions), and keyword opportunities (related keywords, question-based queries).

**With manual data only:**
Ask the user to provide:
1. Target primary keyword and 3-5 secondary keywords
2. Target audience and search intent (informational/commercial/transactional)
3. Target word count and desired tone
4. Any competitor URLs or content examples to reference

Proceed with the full workflow using provided data. Note in the output which metrics are from automated collection vs. user-provided data.

## Instructions

When a user requests SEO content:

1. **Gather Requirements**

   Confirm or ask for:
   
   ```markdown
   ### Content Requirements
   
   **Primary Keyword**: [main keyword]
   **Secondary Keywords**: [2-5 related keywords]
   **Target Word Count**: [length]

   **Search Intent**: [informational/commercial/transactional]
   **Tone**: [professional/casual/technical/friendly]
   **CTA Goal**: [what action should readers take]
   **Competitor URLs**: [top ranking content to beat]
   ```

2. **Load CORE-EEAT Quality Constraints**

   Before writing, load content quality standards from the [CORE-EEAT Benchmark](../../references/core-eeat-benchmark.md):

   ```markdown
   ### CORE-EEAT Pre-Write Checklist

   **Content Type**: [identified from requirements above]

   _These 16 items apply across all content types. For content-type-specific dimension weights, see the Content-Type Weight Table in [core-eeat-benchmark.md](../../references/core-eeat-benchmark.md)._

   ```

3. **Research and Plan**

   Before writing:
   
   ```markdown
   ### Content Research
   
   **SERP Analysis**:
   - Top results format: [what's ranking]
   - Average word count: [X] words
   - Common sections: [list]
   - SERP features: [snippets, PAA, etc.]
   
   **Keyword Map**:
   - Primary: [keyword] - use in title, H1, intro, conclusion
   - Secondary: [keywords] - use in H2s, body paragraphs
   - LSI/Related: [terms] - sprinkle naturally throughout
   - Questions: [PAA questions] - use as H2/H3s or FAQ
   
   **Content Angle**:
   [What unique perspective or value will this content provide?]
   ```

4. **Create Optimized Title**

   ```markdown
   ### Title Optimization
   
   **Requirements**:
   - Include primary keyword (preferably at start)
   - Under 60 characters for full SERP display
   - Compelling and click-worthy
   - Match search intent
   
   **Title Options**:
   
   1. [Title option 1] ([X] chars)
      - Keyword position: [front/middle]
      - Power words: [list]
   
   2. [Title option 2] ([X] chars)
      - Keyword position: [front/middle]
      - Power words: [list]
   
   **Recommended**: [Best option with reasoning]
   ```

5. **Write Meta Description**

   ```markdown
   ### Meta Description
   
   **Requirements**:
   - 150-160 characters
   - Include primary keyword naturally
   - Include call-to-action
   - Compelling and specific
   
   **Meta Description**:
   "[Description text]" ([X] characters)
   
   **Elements included**:
   - ✅ Primary keyword
   - ✅ Value proposition
   - ✅ CTA or curiosity hook
   ```

6. **Structure Content and Write**

   Structure: H1 (primary keyword, one per page) > Introduction (100-150 words, hook + promise + keyword in first 100 words) > H2 sections (secondary keywords/questions) > H3 sub-topics > FAQ section > Conclusion (summary + keyword + CTA).

7. **Apply On-Page SEO Best Practices**

   Follow the on-page SEO checklist (keyword placement, content quality, readability, technical elements) and the content writing template (H1 with keyword, hook, sections with H2/H3, FAQ, conclusion with CTA).

   > **Reference**: See [references/seo-writing-checklist.md](./references/seo-writing-checklist.md) for the full on-page SEO checklist, content writing template, and featured snippet optimization patterns.

   Key requirements while writing:
   - Primary keyword in title, H1, first 100 words, at least one H2, and conclusion
   - Paragraphs of 3-5 sentences; varied sentence length; bullet points and bold key phrases
   - Internal links (2-5) and external authoritative links (2-3)
   - FAQ section with 40-60 word answers for featured snippet opportunity
   - Optimize for definition, list, table, and how-to snippets where applicable

8. **Add Internal/External Links**

   ```markdown
   ### Link Recommendations
   
   **Internal Links** (include 2-5):
   1. "[anchor text]" → [/your-page-url] (relevant because: [reason])
   2. "[anchor text]" → [/your-page-url] (relevant because: [reason])
   
   **External Links** (include 2-3 authoritative sources):
   1. "[anchor text]" → [authoritative-source.com] (supports: [claim])
   2. "[anchor text]" → [authoritative-source.com] (supports: [claim])
   ```

9. **Final SEO Review and CORE-EEAT Self-Check**

    Score content across 10 SEO factors (title, meta description, H1, keyword placement, H2s, internal links, external links, FAQ, readability, word count) and produce an Overall SEO Score out of 10.

    Then verify the 16 CORE-EEAT pre-write constraints (C01, C02, C06, C10, O01, O02, O06, O09, R01, R02, R04, R07, C03, O08, O10, E07) with pass/warning/fail status. List items needing attention.

## Validation Checkpoints

### Input Validation
- [ ] Primary keyword confirmed and matches search intent
- [ ] Target word count specified (minimum 800 words for substantive content)
- [ ] Content type and audience clearly defined

### Output Validation

- [ ] Internal links included (2-5 relevant links)
- [ ] FAQ section present with at least 3 questions
